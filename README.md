## Getting Started
#### Deploy IP-Biter
0) Copy ipb.php in your PHP server and optionally create a .htaccess file as described in the next security notes
    - Some configurable parameters are available in the firsts uncommented PHP lines of the ipb.php file, identified by the comment "START CONFIGURATION SECTION"
#### Access the Dashboard
1) Access the dashboard through ipb.php?op=$dashboardPage (replacing $dashboardPage with its effective value)
    - $dashboardPage is the PHP variable defined in the "START CONFIGURATION SECTION" of the ipb.php file. The default value is "dashboard" so the default URL is `ipb.php?op=dashboard`
    - If the PHP variable $dashboardPage is empty you can access the dashboard through the URL `ipb.php`
    - If the PHP variable $dashboardPageSecret is not empty then a login page will appear, asking for the $dashboardPageSecret value
#### Create a new configuration
2) When the dashboard is opened without parameters, a new configuration is created
    - Another empty new configuration can be generate clicking the "New" button
3) Configure the tracking image and the advanced setting if needed
    - It is possible to left the original image url empty. In this case an empty image will be used.
4) Add tracking links if needed
    - It is possible to left the original link empty. In this case the link will generate a 404 page.
5) **Save the configuration**
6) Distribute the generated image or the links to start the tracking
    - You can click the copy button and paste in a html rich email editor like gmail
    - NOTE: If you try to open the generated image or links but have in the same browser the dashboard page opened and loaded, your request will not be tracked (self-tracking prevention feature)
    
#### Load an existing configuration
7) When the dashboard is opened with the parameter "uuid", the associated configuration is loaded
    - Another configuration can be loaded pasting the "Track UUID" in the dashboard relative field and clicking the "Load" button
8) The reports will be automatically visualized in the "Tracking Reports" section of the dashboard

## Admin Overview Page
1) Access the Admin page through ipb.php?op=$adminPage (replacing $adminPage with its effective value)
    - $adminPage is the PHP variable defined in the "START CONFIGURATION SECTION" of the ipb.php file. The default value is "admin" so the default URL is `ipb.php?op=admin`
    - If the PHP variable $adminPage is empty the admin page will be not available
    - If the PHP variable $adminPageSecret is not empty then a login page will appear, asking for the $adminPageSecret value
2) All the defined configuration will be visualized in a table.

## Security Notes
- Change the folders name and the dashboard page in the configuration section in order to improve the security
- Add the following lines to the .htaccess file in order to deny the access to the "configs" and "reports" folders:
```
DirectoryIndex ipb.php
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(configs/|reports/|error.log) - [F]
</IfModule>
```
